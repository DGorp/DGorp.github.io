# About

This is a repository for my first personal portfolio

## Reason

I've been studying for around six months and I wanted to do this personal portfolio with main web technologies to practice and prove my skills.

## My purpose

I want to become better with web technologies, try different things and experiment many tools.

## More

I'll link more projects on my portfolio, projects that I built while studying, etc.
